# Repo-1
This Repo will have all the practical things/repos/sub-repos you'll need to practically create, in order to understand Git. 
This isn't something scary. When you don't know a thing or the terminology, is only then when you get scared of what actually is happening.

No worries!
This documentation is written in a normal human friendly vibes, you won't get lost in the terminoogies or any other wy.
And definitely, this is going to make you fall in love with learning.
So, No worries, and read the documentation, it'll expand your understanding and knowledge in a friendly humanising way.

Everythings written in the main README File of Git Repo. 
And this Repo-1 is where all the sub repos exist, where you get to practice the Git.

Its better to do things in person, rather than just mugging up tutorials. A combination of both will take you to the horizons
of your highest potential.

So yes, This Repo-1 will lwt you do things in person. And Git is not something you'll understand while just seeing someone else do the changes.
The most easiest way to learn it?
Is to do it yourself,
Fast and Steady.

To make the right or next move in Git!
